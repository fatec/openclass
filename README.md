# openclass

Openclass (www.openclass.ch) is a light social network designed for school teachers. 
It allows students to share photos and text with their smartphones, tablets or computers in a private space, created by the teacher.
The original project was developed as part of the master thesis of Vincent Widmer from University of Geneva.

This GitHub repository contains a Meteor version of openclass.ch developed by St√©phane Morand and Vincent Widmer. Still in development !
